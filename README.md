# Voice Assistant

This is a voice assistant that I've made in Python. It can't do too much right now, but I am planning on continuing to update it as time goes on.

After downloading the code, run it in the terminal by navigating to where the folder is located, going inside the Voice Assistant folder, and typing python main.py. After that, there should be a greeting with the text to speech voice. There is a delay in the greeting and I am not sure what to do about that.

When you want to utilize one of the features, you must use the activation word(Computer) before each query.

# Commands

To have the voice assistant greet you, you should say 'Say hello'. If you replace hello with another word or phrase, it will instead repeat what you said.

To have the assistant search the web, you can say search for, loop for, or look up and the voice assistant will use your default browser to browse Bing for your search terms. If you use the words go to in conjunction with a website (ex: youtube.com instead of just youtube), the voice assistant will take you to the website.

You can have the assistant read off Wikipedia articles by saying the word Wikipedia and then saying the term you want to search for. The assistant will then read off the first article which matches your query.

You can have the voice assistant record notes for you. Say the word log and it will respond to let you know that it is recording.

If you say the words tell me a joke, you can have the assistant read off a joke. Be warned that the jokes may be offensive to some, so use at your own peril.

If you wish to send an email, you can say I need to send an email and the voice assistant will pull up gmail and prepare a new draft for you to use.

If you need a compliment, you can tell the voice assistant compliment me and it will pull a compliment and read it off.

If you need to define a word, say the key word define and then the word you wish to define and the voice assistant will pull all the definitions of that word and read them off.
